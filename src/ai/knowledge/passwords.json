  "password_strength": {
    "definition": "Password strength is a measure of how effective a password is against guessing or brute-force attacks. It's defined by its entropy, not just length or the presence of symbols.",
    "key_factors": {
      "title": "Key Factors of a Strong Password",
      "length": "Longer passwords exponentially increase security. 16+ characters is considered strong.",
      "character_variety": "Includes a mix of lowercase letters (a–z), uppercase letters (A–Z), numbers (0–9), and symbols (!@#$%^&*).",
      "unpredictability": "Avoids common dictionary words, keyboard patterns (like 'qwerty'), and personal information (like names or dates of birth)."
    }
  },
  "password_entropy": {
    "definition": "Entropy measures how unpredictable a password is, calculated in 'bits'. It's the most important measure of password strength. It's calculated using the formula: Entropy = length × log₂(character set size).",
    "explanation": "Attackers don't guess passwords one-by-one; they use automated tools to try billions per second. Higher entropy means it would take an attacker exponentially longer to guess your password.",
    "scale": {
      "title": "Approximate Entropy Scale vs. Crack Time",
      "very_weak": "A password like 'password123' has about 28 bits of entropy and can be cracked in seconds.",
      "weak": "A password like 'P@ssw0rd!' has about 45 bits of entropy and can be cracked in minutes.",
      "strong": "A password like 'Tr9#kL2$A8@Qz!eR' has over 100 bits of entropy and would take centuries to crack."
    },
    "guidance": "These are educational estimates assuming a powerful offline attack. The goal is to maximize entropy."

  "common_mistakes": {
    "title": "Common Password Mistakes",
    "items": [
      "Reusing the same password across multiple websites.",
      "Simply adding a number or symbol at the end of a common word (e.g., 'Password!').",
      "Using predictable keyboard patterns (e.g., 'asdfghjkl').",
      "Using any password that has appeared in a known data breach.",
      "Relying on short passwords, even if they seem complex."

  "password_generator": {
    "definition": "A password generator is a tool that creates random, high-entropy passwords. They are more secure than passwords created by humans because they avoid the predictable patterns humans naturally use.",
    "rules": {
      "title": "Rules for a Secure Password Generator",
      "dos": [
        "Use a cryptographically secure source of randomness (like the Web Crypto API).",
        "Generate passwords that are at least 16 characters long.",

  "password_managers": {
    "definition": "Password managers are applications that securely store your passwords for all your different accounts. They can also generate unique, strong passwords for you.",
    "recommendation": "Using a password manager is the single best practice for password security. It solves the problems of password reuse and the need to remember complex credentials.",
    "examples": "Popular examples include Bitwarden, 1Password, and KeePass."
  },
  "passphrases": {
    "definition": "A passphrase is a sequence of words used as a password. They are often both easier to remember and more secure than traditional complex passwords because their length provides very high entropy.",
    "example": "A passphrase like 'river-orange-laptop-moon-hammer' is much stronger than a password like 'P@ssw0rd1!', despite being easier to type and remember.",
    "recommendation": "Using a passphrase, especially when combined with a password manager, is an ideal security practice."
  },
  "mfa": {
      "definition": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second layer of security to your accounts. Even if an attacker steals your password, they still can't log in without access to your second factor.",
      "types": "Common second factors include codes from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator), hardware security keys (like a YubiKey), or biometrics.",
      "guidance": "MFA is a critical security control and should be enabled on all important accounts. It doesn't fix a weak password, but it mitigates the damage if it's stolen."
